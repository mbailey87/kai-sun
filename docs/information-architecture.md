- Typography: bold rounded sans for H1; clean geometric sans for H2/H3; readable sans for body. Light use of playful micro-copy.
- Color palette: vibrant teal/ocean primary, warm sun-kissed yellow/peach secondary, coral/papaya and mint accents, warm off-white background, soft grey text; maintain accessible contrast.
- Imagery & icons: real drink photography with fresh fruit; subtle ocean/sun cues; simple line icons for ingredient callouts.
- Interactions: gentle hover lifts, button scale/wave underline; potential sticky **Get Directions**/**View Menu** bar on mobile.

## Next Steps for Finalizing Wireframes
To move into build-ready wireframes and visual system, please provide:
- Menu details: drink categories, names, short descriptions, health callouts.
- Snack/treat list.
- Location specifics: address, hours, parking, special notes (drive-through, walk-up, etc.).
- Brand assets: logo, existing colors, preferred imagery.
- Social info: Instagram handle and priority UGC.

This will allow creation of section-level wireframes with example copy and component recommendations.
